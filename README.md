This website is fully responsive personal portfolio, <br />Responsive for all devices, built using Nextjs, TailwindCSS only.

Based on a Portfolio template made by Osama Javaid, contributor  Significant changes were made especially a REACT Switch for Light and Dark mode, and using template literals to change the colors of the component cards for both light and dark. Update of components with my education, experience and expertise.  Code completed with assistance from Austin Heller. A very great learning experience!
